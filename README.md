# Model-Architecture-Generator
This repo is designed to generate the architecture of a given model (randomizing the weights, biases, and all the trained parameters).

### Use

```
python -m randomnize_params -in model_in_path -out model_out_path
```

where model_in_path is the model name or path, and the output is the path the randomized model should be saved.
